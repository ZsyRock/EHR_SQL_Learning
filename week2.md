# The Data Ecosystem and Languages for Data Professionals
### Summary and Highlights

In this lesson, you have learned the following information: 

A data analyst ecosystem includes the infrastructure, software, tools, frameworks, and processes used to gather, clean, analyze, mine, and visualize data.  

Based on how well-defined the structure of the data is, data can be categorized as:

- Structured Data, that is data which is well organized in formats that can be stored in databases.

- Semi-Structured Data, that is data which is partially organized and partially free form.

- Unstructured Data, that is data which can not be organized conventionally into rows and columns.

Data comes in a wide-ranging variety of file formats, such as delimited text files, spreadsheets, XML, PDF, and JSON, each with its own list of benefits and limitations of use.  

Data is extracted from multiple data sources, ranging from relational and non-relational databases to APIs, web services, data streams, social platforms, and sensor devices. 

Once the data is identified and gathered from different sources, it needs to be staged in a data repository so that it can be prepared for analysis. The type, format, and sources of data influence the type of data repository that can be used. 

Data professionals need a host of languages that can help them extract, prepare, and analyze data. These can be classified as:  

- Querying languages, such as SQL, used for accessing and manipulating data from databases. 

- Programming languages such as Python, R, and Java, for developing applications and controlling application behavior.

- Shell and Scripting languages, such as Unix/Linux Shell, and PowerShell, for automating repetitive operational tasks.

1.get-command (gcm) gets all commands
2.get-help + command to get command help
3.clear-host (cls) clears the screen
4.get-location (gl /pwd) gets the current location
5.set-location Set the path cd..Enter the upper-level directory cd+directory Enter the subdirectory
6.get-childitem (ls /dir) gets all child items
7.get-item+filename displays file information
8.new-item+filename new file
9.mkdir (md) + directory name create new directory
10.move-item (mi) + file name (to be moved) + directory name/
11.copy-item + file name + directory Copy the file to the directory
12.rename-item + original file name + file name to be changed to change the name
13.remove-item directory/file name (rm directory/file name) deletes files in the directory
14.add-content file name + "content" adds content to the file, which is an append form.
15.set-content file name + "content" adds content to the file as a replacement form
16.clear-content file name clears file content
17.get-service (gsv) Gets the service running in the local system
18.get-progress (gps/ps) gets the current process
19.convertto-html>"File name.html" converts the object into a web page file
20.export-csv "process.csv" exports the process csv file
Note: Open in Python's virtual isolation environment. You need to add the .ps1 suffix after activate.
