# Senior__Learning

- 30th Jan 2024, I decided to improve myself through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/user/1e6ed734d0da29792d5d11b1c92b623c) because I realized the bottleneck of career development.
  Meanwhile, I began to have the thought of continuing to purchase a PhD in Data Science related field. So I need to do something as proof of my determination, not only for my future mentors, and also for myself, whether I am the candidate with sufficient motivation and strength.

- 31th Jan 2024, I've learned the contents of [Week 1](https://github.com/ZsyRock/IBM-Data-Analyst-Professional-Certificate/blob/main/Week1-What-is-Data-Analytics.md), noted the Responsibilities of a Data Analyst and Qualities and skills to be a Data Analyst;
  
- 1st Feb 2024, I've learned the contents of [Week 2](https://github.com/ZsyRock/IBM-Data-Analyst-Professional-Certificate/blob/main/week2-The-Data-Ecosystem.md) and noted the Data Ecosystem and Languages for Data Professionals, also I noted some commend of Shell and Scripting languages.
