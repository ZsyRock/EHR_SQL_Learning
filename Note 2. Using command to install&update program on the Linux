# Updating/Uninstalling program on Linux

Running "dpkg -s vlc" shows you that vlc is installed, but also that the version is out-of-date. (Version 2.2.7 is installed, but the newest version is at least 3.0.12)

### dpkg -s vlc

VLC media player is already installed on your computer, but the version that's installed is out-of-date. You'll fix that now by updating it to the newest version. To do that, force an update of the package manager, using this command:

### sudo apt-get install -f

You can see here that VLC has been updated to a newer version (3.0.12 was the newest at the time this screenshot was taken). Your version should be at least 3.0.12, but could be higher if newer versions have been released.


# Installing Mozilla Firefox

Let's install the Mozilla Firefox web browser. Parts of this process will be unique to this specific installation, but most of the steps you'll take will be identical, regardless of the software.

Lots of common programs, including Firefox, are set up in repositories that most Linux distributions are aware of, by default. This makes installing these programs super easy, and allows you to bypass having to manually download and install the program. To make sure these repositories are up-to-date and all dependencies are fixed, run this command in the terminal (you will have to enter the letter "Y" at some point during the process to confirm your action):

### sudo apt-get update

Now you're ready to install Firefox. Run the command below in the terminal:

### sudo apt-get install firefox-esr

Check the details:

### dpkg -s firefox-esr

# Uninstalling GIMP

When it's no longer necessary to have a specific program installed on your computer, it's usually a good idea to uninstall it to clear up space. Now, you'll uninstall the GIMP photo-editing software, removing it from the computer completely.

GIMP, like Firefox, can be installed and uninstalled using the "apt-get" commands that you used to install Firefox. To uninstall GIMP, a very similar command is used:

### sudo apt-get remove gimp

check if gimp already uninstalled

### dpkg -s gimp
